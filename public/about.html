<h1>About Me</h1>

  these techincs to my development to better help future projects.

  My spare time is consumed by playing with my dog Enzo, Working on cars, fourwheelers, etc as I come from a mechanicly
  inclined family and always had a pascuion for building and fixing stuff.  My reason for entering the web development
  era is because I have always found tecnology interesting and been amazed about how computers are able to speak to each other.
